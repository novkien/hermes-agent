# Jarvis/Hermes — Repository Agent Guide

This file is the compact repository entrypoint for AI coding assistants, Hermes agents,
and human maintainers working in `novkien/hermes-agent`.

It explains where this application repository fits in Le Kien's wider Jarvis/Hermes
system. It is intentionally shorter than a full architecture manual. Deep deployment,
network, control-plane, instruction-layer, plugin-source, and profile-SOUL context lives
in the installed `hermes-agent` skill and its focused references.

## Authority and precedence

Le Kien is the owner and final decision authority.

Apply instructions in this order:

1. the newest explicit owner directive;
2. the current task's exact scope and target;
3. this repository guide;
4. the installed `hermes-agent` skill and the directly relevant reference;
5. current source, configuration structure, service state, logs, and runtime evidence;
6. older documentation and historical reports.

Never let an older reference override a newer owner decision or current evidence.

## Default work classification

Reading and searching this repository is allowed whenever it is needed to understand
Hermes behavior, trace an execution path, or identify the correct instruction surface.

A request is **not** permission to modify application source merely because source
inspection is useful.

Use these rules:

- Requests about skills, prompts, references, SOUL, context, role behavior,
  evaluation, reporting, or agent instructions are instruction-layer work by default.
- A general, ambiguous, or outcome-only request is not source-code authorization.
- Modify executable application source only when the owner explicitly requests a code,
  runtime, plugin, service, router, tool, dashboard, or other executable change.
- When code modification is explicitly authorized, execute the requested scope instead
  of redirecting it back to instruction-layer advice.
- Documentation changes to `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` remain repository documentation
  work; they do not authorize unrelated code changes.

## What this repository is

`novkien/hermes-agent` is the application source for the Hermes agent runtime and its
core surfaces:

- conversation and tool-calling loop;
- prompt and context assembly;
- CLI, TUI, web dashboard, desktop, AgentOS Mission Control, and messaging gateway surfaces;
- Telegram and other platform adapters;
- tools, toolsets, plugin framework/integration, skills integration, cron, memory,
  sessions, and profiles;
- tests, installer, documentation, and update mechanics.

This repository is **one component** of the Jarvis/Hermes deployment. It is not the
entire deployed system and is not the source of truth for live process state, private
shared skills, owner-managed external plugin packages, or profile `SOUL.md` definitions.

### Current component roles

| Component | Current role | Current location or repository |
|---|---|---|
| Hermes application | Agent runtime, gateway, tools, profiles, sessions, plugin framework and skills integration | This repository; deployed checkout normally `/home/jarvis/.hermes/hermes-agent` |
| Telegram | Primary owner conversation surface | Hermes gateway platform adapter |
| AgentOS Mission Control | Browser control plane for the whole Jarvis/Hermes system; independent sibling service to the gateway | Native app under `apps/mission-control/`; deployed on the Jarvis/Hermes host |
| AgentOS external adapter | Temporary external data/mutation bridge consumed by AgentOS through bounded supported routes | Jarvis host; remains separate until an owner-authorized merge plan changes that boundary |
| 9router | General LLM/provider routing path | Pi; external project at `/home/pi/9router` |
| llama-proxy | Local model routing, wake/switch/unload lifecycle, dashboard and ComfyUI passthrough | `novkien/llama-proxy`; Pi |
| Skill registry | Canonical source for shared skills and profile-selectable skill packs | Private `novkien/hermes-skills` |
| Plugin registry | Canonical source for owner-managed gateway/runtime plugin packages | Private `novkien/hermes-plugins`; live packages under `/home/jarvis/.hermes/plugins/` |
| Agent SOUL registry | Canonical reviewed source for profile `SOUL.md` definitions | Private `novkien/agents`; deployed files under `/home/jarvis/.hermes/agents/<profile>/SOUL.md` |

Addresses, ports, process identities, active models, bindings, branches, and commit SHAs
are volatile facts. Before an operational action, reverify them from current evidence.
The private `hermes-agent` skill contains the latest observed topology and the exact
reverification contract.

## Load deeper system context only when needed

When running inside Hermes and the task concerns Jarvis/Hermes architecture,
repositories, runtime topology, AgentOS, Telegram routing, LLM proxies, skills,
plugins, profile SOUL, context loading, profiles, or deployment, load:

```text
skill_view("hermes-agent")
```

Then load only the directly relevant reference named by that skill. Do not preload the
entire reference library.

The installed skill is expected at:

```text
/home/jarvis/.hermes/skills/autonomous-ai-agents/hermes-agent/
```

Its canonical Git source is:

```text
novkien/hermes-skills:
skills/autonomous-ai-agents/hermes-agent/
```

## Context architecture

The intended context hierarchy is:

```text
Repository AGENTS.md
  └─ compact, common repository and owner boundaries

Installed hermes-agent SKILL.md
  └─ broad Jarvis/Hermes system context and routing table

Focused skill references
  ├─ system topology and hosts
  ├─ AgentOS and adapter
  ├─ 9router and llama-proxy
  ├─ Telegram and multi-agent routing
  ├─ repositories and change control
  ├─ context loading and skill routing
  ├─ skills registry and profile packs
  ├─ external gateway plugins and profile SOUL sources
  └─ freshness and source-of-truth rules

Current source/runtime evidence
  └─ authoritative for current implementation and deployment state
```

`AGENTS.md` must not become a dump of every subsystem detail. Put reusable deep detail
in a focused skill reference. Put deterministic behavior in code or a script. Put
current live facts in evidence rather than treating a dated document as timeless.

## Repository and deployment map

| Repository | Purpose | Normal write boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `novkien/hermes-agent` | Hermes application fork | Application source and root repository documentation |
| `NousResearch/hermes-agent` | Upstream Hermes project | Read/fetch/update source; do not push owner changes here |
| `novkien/hermes-skills` | Shared skills and profile-selectable skill packs | Instruction-layer skills, references, scripts, templates, tests and harnesses |
| `novkien/hermes-plugins` | Owner-managed Hermes gateway/runtime plugins | External plugin packages and their plugin-owned tests/configuration; not live runtime state |
| `novkien/agents` | Reviewed profile `SOUL.md` definitions | Profile `SOUL.md` files only; profile import code/config remains outside this repository unless explicitly added |
| `novkien/agent-mission-control` | Historical AgentOS source imported at commit `42a9c191fdebc66ace4aac98a1e581d9ab7a13d1` | Provenance only after merge; canonical source is `apps/mission-control/` in this repository |
| `novkien/llama-proxy` | Sanitized llama-proxy source | Proxy application source |

Do not infer a remote's purpose from its name. Read current Git configuration and
branch state before pull, push, merge, or update work.

### Skills deployment

The live skill roots remain:

```text
/home/jarvis/.hermes/skills/
/home/jarvis/.hermes/workspace/skills-pack/
```

They are tracked by the private skills repository through a separate Git directory:

```text
/home/jarvis/.hermes/repos/hermes-skills.git
```

Bridge deploys an owner-authorized merged skills commit with a fast-forward-only pull:

```bash
git \
  --git-dir=/home/jarvis/.hermes/repos/hermes-skills.git \
  --work-tree=/home/jarvis/.hermes \
  pull --ff-only origin main
```

For repository-tracked skill paths, this Git transport replaces apply-ZIP unless the
owner explicitly selects apply-ZIP for that operation. Cache refresh, session reset,
service reload, and behavioral verification are separate actions and must be reported
separately.

### Plugin and SOUL source boundaries

The owner-managed plugin source and profile SOUL source are separate from both this
application repository and the skills registry:

```text
novkien/hermes-plugins
  → reviewed gateway/runtime plugin packages
  → deployed package root: /home/jarvis/.hermes/plugins/

novkien/agents
  → reviewed <profile>/SOUL.md files
  → deployed file: /home/jarvis/.hermes/agents/<profile>/SOUL.md
```

A GitHub commit in either repository does not prove the corresponding live bytes were
deployed, a service reloaded, a session reset, or behavior changed. Verify those steps
separately when the task includes deployment or activation.

The `plugins/` directory inside this application repository is the application plugin
framework and bundled/built-in plugin surface. Do not confuse it with the owner's
separately versioned external plugin packages in `novkien/hermes-plugins`.

## Network model

The current deployment prefers LAN routes. Tailnet routes are required fallbacks for:

- LAN failure;
- hosts deployed in different physical networks;
- future distribution of AgentOS, proxies, workers, or model servers.

Do not hardcode a Tailnet IP in public repository documentation. Resolve the current
Tailnet DNS name/IP from `tailscale status --json` or the private system-context
reference before use. Do not silently fall back to historical `192.168.0.x` addresses.

## Deep codebase development guide

When executable application-source work is explicitly authorized, read
[`docs/HERMES_CODEBASE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/HERMES_CODEBASE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)
before editing. It preserves the detailed architecture, contribution, testing, platform,
and implementation conventions that previously lived in root `AGENTS.md`, while keeping
the default context compact. Current owner directives, current source, and any more
specific nested `AGENTS.md` take precedence.

## Application source map

The filesystem is the source of truth; this map names the load-bearing areas rather
than every file.

## Load-bearing design invariants

Preserve these unless the owner explicitly requests a redesign:

1. **Prompt-cache stability.** A conversation's stable prefix and tool surface should
   remain byte-stable where the architecture requires it. Do not rebuild or mutate old
   prompt content casually.
2. **Strict message alternation and session integrity.** Do not inject synthetic turns
   in ways that violate provider message ordering or corrupt persisted history.
3. **Narrow core tool surface.** Prefer an existing tool, CLI command plus skill,
   service-gated tool, external plugin, or MCP integration before adding a permanent
   core model tool.
4. **Session-scoped capabilities.** UI/client capabilities are determined by the
   session and platform, not only by process environment.
5. **Configuration separation.** Behavioral configuration belongs in `config.yaml`;
   `.env` is for credentials and secrets.
6. **Profiles are explicit scopes.** Do not flatten skill packs, profile SOUL, or
   profile state merely for convenience.
7. **Evidence-backed behavior claims.** Code proves implementation; reviewed Git source
   proves repository content; runtime evidence proves deployment and current behavior.
   One does not substitute for another.

## Change workflow

For every authorized change:

1. Restate the exact outcome and scope internally.
2. Inspect the smallest set of current source/evidence required.
3. Verify the premise against the current implementation before calling something a
   defect.
4. Select the smallest correct target and repository: application/documentation,
   shared skill/profile pack, external plugin, profile SOUL, AgentOS, proxy, config,
   service, or other code.
5. Author complete final files. Do not use fragment patches as the normal Hermes
   handoff format.
6. Preserve unrelated behavior and profile boundaries.
7. Use a branch and pull request for owner repositories unless the owner explicitly
   selects a different Git operation.
8. Run the tests or checks requested by the owner or materially required by the
   changed surface.
9. Report writes, commits, PR/merge state, pulls, reloads, resets, and behavioral
   outcomes as separate facts.

Do not transform an execution request into review-only advice. Do not add an approval
layer that the owner did not request.

## Security

- Never place credentials, passwords, private keys, bot tokens, API keys, cookies, or
  authorization headers in repository documentation, skills, plugins, or SOUL files.
- Store only the name/location class of a secret, never its value.
- Do not publish live databases, WAL/SHM files, logs, session stores, model weights,
  runtime state, or unreviewed backups.
- Treat repository visibility as a current GitHub fact, not an assumption.
- A historical secret found in Git history requires owner-facing reporting and secret
  rotation; do not reproduce the value in a report.

## Verification and completion evidence

A complete report distinguishes:

```text
SOURCE_INSPECTED:
FILES_CREATED:
FILES_REPLACED:
FILES_DELETED:
COMMIT_CREATED:
REMOTE_UPDATED:
PULL_REQUEST:
LOCAL_PULL_RESULT:
CACHE_REFRESH_RESULT:
SESSION_RESET_RESULT:
SERVICE_RELOAD_RESULT:
BEHAVIORAL_TEST_RESULT:
UNRESOLVED_FACTS:
```

Never claim a commit, PR merge, pull, reload, activation, or behavior change without
the corresponding result.
